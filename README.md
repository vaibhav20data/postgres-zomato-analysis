# PostgreSQL Zomato Analysis

End-to-end PostgreSQL analytics project using a food delivery dataset.

## Overview

This project analyzes a food delivery platform to uncover insights about:
- Customer ordering behavior
- Restaurant performance
- Revenue trends
- Customer segmentation
- Month-over-month growth

The analysis is done entirely using PostgreSQL with realistic relational data.

---

## Database Schema

The database is designed using a normalized relational schema to model a real-world
food delivery system.

### Tables
- customers
- restaurants
- orders
- deliveries
- riders

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## SQL Analysis & Business Questions

This project contains **multiple analytical SQL queries** written in PostgreSQL.
Below are some **sample analyses and representative outputs** that highlight the type
of business questions addressed in the project.

### 1. Q1 - Top Dishes Ordered by Each Customer
- Identifies the most frequently ordered dishes for individual customers
- Uses aggregation and window functions such as `RANK`
- Helps understand customer preferences and repeat behavior

### 2. Q6 - Top Restaurants by Revenue (City-wise)
- Calculates total revenue generated by each restaurant
- Ranks restaurants within a city based on revenue
- Uses `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, and window functions

### 3. Q12 - Customer Segmentation
- Segments customers into **Gold** and **Silver** categories
- Classification is based on comparison with average customer spending
- Demonstrates conditional logic using `CASE WHEN`

### 4. Q20 - Month-over-Month Order Growth
- Tracks how order volumes change over time for restaurants
- Uses `LAG` to compute order differences and percentage growth
- Helps identify trends and seasonality

> Additional queries covering customer behavior, restaurant performance,
and order trends are available in the `queries/` directory.
